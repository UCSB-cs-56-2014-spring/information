Computer Science 24 with a grade of C or better.

## Recommended preparation

Students are encouraged to complete Computer Science 32 prior to enrolling in Computer Science 56.

Topics include generic programming, exception handling, programming language implementation; automatic memory management, & application development, management, & maintenance tools; event handling, concurrency & threading, & advanced library use.

======

As an instructor, my goal is to encourage you to become a more self-directed learner. I believe that the future belongs to those who enjoy learning things for themselves. I consequently hope that you explore some additional topics that are of personal interest. Self-directed learning, like any skill, takes practice. Persevere. Self-directed does not mean that you cannot talk to people. It means that you take personal responsibility for organizing & executing—in a word, directing—your own learning plan. I would love to discuss any plans you may have or wish to formulate for self-directed learning.

I also have some suggestions for succeeding in this course.

## Written Communication

Students present their solutions to programming problems on both homework & examinations. Precision, clarity, & readability are the coin of this communication realm.

## Workload

This is a 4-credit course at UCSB. You are expected to finish this course in 10 weeks, working *intelligently* for an average of 10 hours/week.
